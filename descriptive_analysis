Also, because of the minimum price, we can confidently say that there are cryptocurrencies extremely cheap and afordable in the Top50.
    Conclusion: CryptoMarket is extremely unbalanced, but afordable depending on the currency.

2. Market Cap 
- The average is around 62 bilions of $, while the median is 8 bilions of $, so again a skewed distribution. 
    Conclusion: Lower market cap assets are more volatile and more susceptible to price manipulation, making them riskier for investing, compared to major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

3. Total volume 24h
    Conclusion: The majority of currencies have a modest trading volume, but some of the assets have a significantly high trading volume, suggesting strong investor interest and a very active market.

4. Absolute and procentual changes 24h
    Conclusion: The wide fluctuation range, from -16% to +14%, highlights a strong volatility. This instability suggests that there can be short-term trading opportunities, but these are also associated with a notably high risk.
